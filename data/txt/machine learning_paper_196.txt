Abstract:
In recent years, data and computing resources are typically distributed in the devices of end users, various regions or organizations. Because of laws or regulations, the distributed data and computing resources cannot be aggregated or directly shared among different regions or organizations for machine learning tasks. Federated learning emerges as an efficient approach to exploit distributed data and computing resources, so as to collaboratively train machine learning models. At the same time, federated learning obeys the laws and regulations and ensures data security and data privacy. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of existing works for federated learning. First, we propose a functional architecture of federated learning systems and a taxonomy of related techniques. Second, we explain the federated learning systems from four aspects: diverse types of parallelism, aggregation algorithms, data communication, and the security of federated learning systems. Third, we present four widely used federated systems based on the functional architecture. Finally, we summarize the limitations and propose future research directions.
