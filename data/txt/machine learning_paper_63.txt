Abstract:
Machine learning is poised as a very powerful tool that can drastically
improve our ability to carry out scientific research. However, many issues need
to be addressed before this becomes a reality. This article focuses on one
particular issue of broad interest: How can we integrate machine learning with
physics-based modeling to develop new interpretable and truly reliable physical
models? After introducing the general guidelines, we discuss the two most
important issues for developing machine learning-based physical models:
Imposing physical constraints and obtaining optimal datasets. We also provide a
simple and intuitive explanation for the fundamental reasons behind the success
of modern machine learning, as well as an introduction to the concurrent
machine learning framework needed for integrating machine learning with
physics-based modeling. Molecular dynamics and moment closure of kinetic
equations are used as examples to illustrate the main issues discussed. We end
with a general discussion on where this integration will lead us to, and where
the new frontier will be after machine learning is successfully integrated into
scientific modeling.
