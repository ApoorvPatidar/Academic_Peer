Abstract:
The number of machine learning, artificial intelligence or data science
related software engineering projects using Agile methodology is increasing.
However, there are very few studies on how such projects work in practice. In
this paper, we analyze project issues tracking data taken from Scrum (a popular
tool for Agile) for several machine learning projects. We compare this data
with corresponding data from non-machine learning projects, in an attempt to
analyze how machine learning projects are executed differently from normal
software engineering projects. On analysis, we find that machine learning
project issues use different kinds of words to describe issues, have higher
number of exploratory or research oriented tasks as compared to implementation
tasks, and have a higher number of issues in the product backlog after each
sprint, denoting that it is more difficult to estimate the duration of machine
learning project related tasks in advance. After analyzing this data, we
propose a few ways in which Agile machine learning projects can be better
logged and executed, given their differences with normal software engineering
projects.
