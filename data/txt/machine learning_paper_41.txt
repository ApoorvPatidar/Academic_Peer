Abstract:
Machine learning is a quickly evolving field which now looks really different
from what it was 15 years ago, when classification and clustering were major
issues. This document proposes several trends to explore the new questions of
modern machine learning, with the strong afterthought that the belief function
framework has a major role to play.
