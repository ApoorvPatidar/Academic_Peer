Abstract:
River is a machine learning library for dynamic data streams and continual learning. It provides multiple state-of-the-art learning methods, data generators/transformers, performance metrics and evaluators for different stream learning problems. It is the result from the merger of the two most popular packages for stream learning in Python: Creme and scikit-multiflow. River introduces a revamped architecture based on the lessons learnt from the seminal packages. River's ambition is to be the go-to library for doing machine learning on streaming data. Additionally, this open source package brings under the same umbrella a large community of practitioners and researchers. The source code is available at https://github.com/online-ml/river.
