Abstract:
$\textit{Pymc-learn}$ is a Python package providing a variety of
state-of-the-art probabilistic models for supervised and unsupervised machine
learning. It is inspired by $\textit{scikit-learn}$ and focuses on bringing
probabilistic machine learning to non-specialists. It uses a general-purpose
high-level language that mimics $\textit{scikit-learn}$. Emphasis is put on
ease of use, productivity, flexibility, performance, documentation, and an API
consistent with $\textit{scikit-learn}$. It depends on $\textit{scikit-learn}$
and $\textit{pymc3}$ and is distributed under the new BSD-3 license,
encouraging its use in both academia and industry. Source code, binaries, and
documentation are available on http://github.com/pymc-learn/pymc-learn.
