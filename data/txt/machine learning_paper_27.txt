Abstract:
The aim of these notes is to demonstrate the potential for ideas in machine
learning to impact on the fields of inverse problems and data assimilation. The
perspective is one that is primarily aimed at researchers from inverse problems
and/or data assimilation who wish to see a mathematical presentation of machine
learning as it pertains to their fields. As a by-product, we include a succinct
mathematical treatment of various topics in machine learning.
