Abstract:
Process curves are multivariate finite time series data coming from
manufacturing processes. This paper studies machine learning that detect drifts
in process curve datasets. A theoretic framework to synthetically generate
process curves in a controlled way is introduced in order to benchmark machine
learning algorithms for process drift detection. An evaluation score, called
the temporal area under the curve, is introduced, which allows to quantify how
well machine learning models unveil curves belonging to drift segments.
Finally, a benchmark study comparing popular machine learning approaches on
synthetic data generated with the introduced framework is presented that shows
that existing algorithms often struggle with datasets containing multiple drift
segments.
