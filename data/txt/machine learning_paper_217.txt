Abstract:
Perhaps one of the most common and comprehensive statistical and machine learning algorithms are linear regression. Linear regression is used to find a linear relationship between one or more predictors. The linear regression has two types: simple regression and multiple regression (MLR). This paper discusses various works by different researchers on linear regression and polynomial regression and compares their performance using the best approach to optimize prediction and precision. Almost all of the articles analyzed in this review is focused on datasets; in order to determine a model's efficiency, it must be correlated with the actual values obtained for the explanatory variables.
