Abstract:
Recently, an increasing number of laws have governed the useability of users'
privacy. For example, Article 17 of the General Data Protection Regulation
(GDPR), the right to be forgotten, requires machine learning applications to
remove a portion of data from a dataset and retrain it if the user makes such a
request. Furthermore, from the security perspective, training data for machine
learning models, i.e., data that may contain user privacy, should be
effectively protected, including appropriate erasure. Therefore, researchers
propose various privacy-preserving methods to deal with such issues as machine
unlearning. This paper provides an in-depth review of the security and privacy
concerns in machine learning models. First, we present how machine learning can
use users' private data in daily life and the role that the GDPR plays in this
problem. Then, we introduce the concept of machine unlearning by describing the
security threats in machine learning models and how to protect users' privacy
from being violated using machine learning platforms. As the core content of
the paper, we introduce and analyze current machine unlearning approaches and
several representative research results and discuss them in the context of the
data lineage. Furthermore, we also discuss the future research challenges in
this field.
