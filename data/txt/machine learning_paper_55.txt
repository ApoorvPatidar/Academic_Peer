Abstract:
Quantifying and managing uncertainties that occur when data-driven models
such as those provided by AI and machine learning methods are applied is
crucial. This whitepaper provides a brief motivation and first overview of the
state of the art in identifying and quantifying sources of uncertainty for
data-driven components as well as means for analyzing their impact.
